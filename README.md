## My process

### Built with

-   [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS library
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React library
-   [React-Responsive](https://github.com/yocontra/react-responsive) - React library
-   [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - React library
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
-   [Tailwindcss-form](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) - plugin
-   [Tailwind-prettier-plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) - plugin
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   CSS custom properties
-   FlexBox
-   CSS Grid

### What I learned

-   Learned about react-hook-forms while building this project, to manage all form related state. Never used the library before as I was always managing state myself (re-inventing the wheel over and over). Made handling form states, errors and all things related, extremely easy to me. Can't live without it now.
-   Utilized the tailwindcss form plugin, which made it easy to modify styles on browser-defaults, that normally require overriding or some excess code, to create a custom input element.
